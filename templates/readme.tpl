QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a
specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The 
squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around
the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800
segments or tiles covering earth.

The files in this folder covers such tiles for GIVE_NAME on what is 
referred to as level GIVE_LEVEL
A buffer to the closest full degree around the country is 
used.

		Bonne was chosen because I needed a global
		projection for generating files based on
		one source file.
