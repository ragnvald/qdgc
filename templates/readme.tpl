QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares
covering a specific area to represent specific qualities of
the area covered. The squares themselves are based on the
degree squares covering earth. Around the equator we have
360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this
gives us 64800 segments or tiles covering earth.

The files in this folder covers such tiles for 
GIVE_NAME on what is referred to as level GIVE_LEVEL
It is based on a buffer of 100 kms around the contry.

		Prime Meridian: 0

LON		Calculated With XTools

ARAEA	Calculated with XTools
		using the Bonne projection. You are adviced to
		recalculate the areas using a more local
		projection if the area calculation is important
		for your work.

		Bonne was chosen because I needed a global
		projection for generating files based on
		one source file.
