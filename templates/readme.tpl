QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a
specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The 
squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around
the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800
segments or tiles covering earth.

The files in this folder covers such tiles for GIVE_NAME on what is 
referred to as level GIVE_LEVEL. A buffer to the closest full degree
around the country is used.

Delivered files:
qdgc_0GIVE_LEVEL_GIVE_CODE.dbf   Attribute file
qdgc_0GIVE_LEVEL_GIVE_CODE.prj   Projection file
qdgc_0GIVE_LEVEL_GIVE_CODE.shp   Spatial data file (shapefile)
qdgc_0GIVE_LEVEL_GIVE_CODE.shx   Index file

The files were packed in individual zipped folders together with
this readme file.

		FME is using the AZMEA (ALambert Azimuthal Equal
    Area Projection) for area calculations. You are 
    adviced to recalculate the areas using a more local
		projection if the area calculation is important
		for your work.
