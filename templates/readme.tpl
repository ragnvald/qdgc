QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a
specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The 
squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around
the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800
segments or tiles covering earth.

The geopackage file(s) provided are named by country and zipped. Examples are:
-qdgc_zambia.zip
-qdgc_tanzania.zip
-qdgc_ghana.zip
-etc

Within each geopackage file you will find a number of tables with these names:

-tbl_qdgc_01
-tbl_qdgc_02
-tbl_qdgc_03
-tbl_qdgc_04
-tbl_qdgc_05

etc

		FME is using the AZMEA (ALambert Azimuthal Equal
    Area Projection) for area calculations. You are 
    adviced to recalculate the areas using a more local
		projection if the area calculation is important
		for your work.
