QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a
specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The 
squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around
the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800
segments or tiles covering earth.

The geopackage file(s) provided are named by country and zipped. Examples are:
-qdgc_zambia.zip
-qdgc_tanzania.zip
-qdgc_ghana.zip
-etc

Within each geopackage file you will find a number of tables with these names:

-tbl_qdgc_01
-tbl_qdgc_02
-tbl_qdgc_03
-tbl_qdgc_04
-tbl_qdgc_05
-etc


Metadata
--------
Geodata	GCS_WGS_1984
		Datum: D_WGS_1984
		Prime Meridian: 0

Area was calculated with PostgIS function st_area:
- (st_area(st_transform(geom, 102008))/1000000)
