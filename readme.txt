QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a
specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The 
squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around
the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the
south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800
segments or tiles covering earth.

Within each geopackage file you will find a number of tables with these names:

-tbl_qdgc_01
-tbl_qdgc_02
-tbl_qdgc_03
-tbl_qdgc_04
-tbl_qdgc_05
-etc

The attributes for each table are:

qdgc			Unique Quarter Degree Grid Cell reference string
area_reference		Country
level_qdgc		QDGC level
cellsize degrees	decimal degree for the longitudal and latitudal length of the cell
lon_center		Longitude center of the cell
lat_center		Latitudal center of the cell
area_km2		Calculated area for the cell
geom			Geometry

Metadata
--------
Geodata	GCS_WGS_1984
	Datum: D_WGS_1984
	Prime Meridian: 0

Area was calculated with PostgIS function st_area:
- (st_area(st_transform(geom, 102008))/1000000)
